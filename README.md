# mnist_draw

Allows you to run your own hand-drawn digits through an MNIST classifier. Interesting for understanding how the model is or isn't invariant to certain changes (and also interesting as a way for me to learn tkinter and pytorch).

# Usage
1. Clone this repo
2. `python3 draw.py`
3. Draw a digit (or soemthing else, if you're curious)
4. Press classify
